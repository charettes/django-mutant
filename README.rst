********
Overview
********

`Django`_ provides a great ORM and with the power of `South`_ one can easily perform schema alteration.

However, some projects may require *runtime* schema alteration and that's what `django-mutant`_ ought to provide.

The main concept was inspired by those projects:

- Will Hardy `dynamic-models`_'s `documentation`_ and `talk`_.
- And by `django-dynamo`_.

************************
Direction of the project
************************
`django-mutant`_ is actually using `South`_ under the hood to provide schema migrations. Since the `schema editor code is being merged`_ into the main `Django`_ code base the next major version of mutant will rely on it instead thus dropping the external dependency on `South`.
